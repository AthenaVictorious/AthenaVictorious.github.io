This is a website for me to learn how to build a website from the ground up. 

I plan to learn DNS records, subdomains, and how to build a website using html and other languages.

I may even post my thoughts on the website blog-style to see if any particular topics inspire me to start a blog or business.

The goal is to be bare-bones, no template website builders, for maximum learning.

Later I may even create a "shop." subdomain and create a practice e-commerce store from scratch.
